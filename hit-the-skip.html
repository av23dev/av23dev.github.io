                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">About</h2>
                    <p>Hit The Skip was a project developed by me in Unity/C#. It’s a project focused on movement mechanics like wall running and sliding. It also addresses making basic movement solid. </p>
                    <p>The unique aspect of this project is that there are movement techniques that are inspired by exploits from other games, such as Well Skating from Destiny 2.</p>
                    <p>I designed and developed this entire project.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Important Points</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Certain input combinations or conditions allow for special movement techniques</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">This project is heavily focused on the technical aspect of character movement</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">A movement system that includes: sliding, wall running, mantling, air strafing</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Consistent basic movement system; things like jumping or moving diagonally does not increase speed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Details</h2>
                    <h3>Basic Movement System</h3>
                    <p>The movement is rigid body based and moves through adding force based on the player’s inputs. There is a constant force that decelerates the player based on different states like if the player is crouching, walking, off the ground, etc. </p>

                    <h3>Design and The Reasoning Behind</h3>
                    <p>The map has a number of cosmetic choices. This so I can learn about Unreal’s artistic aspects.</p>
                    <p>I learned about the material system and the particle system in Unreal along with post processing, bloom, foliage, light emission, skyboxes, and more.</p>

                    <h3>Biggest Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge was learning C++ and Unreal Engine. I transitioned from C# and Unity but was able to understand fast. Unreal Engine structures things differently than Unity, that includes how C++ works, but I was able to adapt quickly and produce this project from scratch.</p>
                    <p>The structure of Unreal Engine also challenged me. One example is Unity uses Gameobjects with components and scripts attached to them, while Unreal uses a class (“script”) as the base which then attaches components to them. There are a number of other differences in structure that challenged me, but I was able to learn in the end.</p>
