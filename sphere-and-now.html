                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">About</h2>
                    <p>Sphere and Now was created to help me understand C++ and the Unreal Engine. A majority of this project was programmed in C++ from scratch.</p>
                    <p>In this game demo you roll a sphere on a course while picking up other spheres along the way. The goal is to get as many spheres as possible to the end. </p>
                    <p>I designed and developed this entire project.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Important Points</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Majority of the project is in C++ code that I wrote</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Made in the Unreal Engine</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Physics are used such as sphere rolling and a section with wind that pushes objects.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Different materials and foliage are used in the terrain to help me learn more about the engine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Details</h2>
                    <h3>Programming Structure</h3>
                    <p>This project was mainly created with C++, however I did not neglect using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system and have learned how to use it. I wanted to really learn the engine so I used different aspects and tools found throughout the editor. The code involves physics interactions and communication between the Actors such as other spheres following.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this helped solidify my understanding of Unreal Engine and C++. </p>

                    <h3>Design and The Reasoning Behind</h3>
                    <p>The map has a number of cosmetic choices. This so I can learn about Unreal’s artistic aspects.</p>
                    <p>I learned about the material system and the particle system in Unreal along with post processing, bloom, foliage, light emission, skyboxes, and more.</p>

                    <h3>Biggest Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge was learning C++ and Unreal Engine. I transitioned from C# and Unity but was able to understand fast. Unreal Engine structures things differently than Unity, that includes how C++ works, but I was able to adapt quickly and produce this project from scratch.</p>
                    <p>The structure of Unreal Engine also challenged me. One example is Unity uses Gameobjects with components and scripts attached to them, while Unreal uses a class (“script”) as the base which then attaches components to them. There are a number of other differences in structure that challenged me, but I was able to learn in the end.</p>
