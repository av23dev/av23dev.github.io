                    <p>I’ve been programming games with Unity / C# for about 4 years now and I’ve been wanting to professionally get into the career of game design and work with a team. The projects that I develop are more geared towards the FPS genre and their weapons because I’m inspired by games like TF2, Apex Legends, Destiny 2, etc.</p>
                    <p>I have the soft skills to work with others. I consider other’s ideas, compromise, de-escalate, and communicate clearly either through writing or verbally. I am more than willing to work cooperatively with a team and to learn any new technologies.</p>
                    <p>I also do some work in Blender for 3D modelling and for my education I have an Associates Degree in Engineering.</p>
                    <p>I hope to be given a chance join and work with a game development team to help further my knowledge and to contribute my efforts to help a company succeed and to help create an enjoyable game.</p>
